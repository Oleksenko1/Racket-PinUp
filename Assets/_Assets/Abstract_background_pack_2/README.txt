Thank you for downloading this Abstract Background pack.

I was experimenting with designing abstract backgrounds and thought some looked rather nice. Enjoy.
You can do whatever you want with the backgrounds, including commercial use, no need for attribution.

Credit Joh if you want to give credit.

What would be appreciated is a follow! On itch and/or Twitter!
Stay updated on if theres more to come or other upcoming projects!
